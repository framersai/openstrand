# Assistant Onboarding (OS / Weaver)

Welcome! This guide walks you through enabling and using the OS Assistant.

## 1) Enable the assistant

- Open Settings → Assistant
- Toggle “Enable Assistant”
- Choose frequency: Automatic (default), Scheduled, or Manual
- Set quiet hours and tone (“calm coach with subtle humor”)

## 2) Daily & hourly passes

- Everyone gets daily check-ins in the feed
- Paid plans: hourly evaluations (configurable by admins down to the minute)
- The assistant only posts when it has something useful

## 3) Using the modal

- Press the global shortcut to open the assistant (configurable)
- Ask questions in natural language; it can summarize recent activity, suggest next steps, or propose organizing actions
- Actions are suggestions (no tasks model yet) — apply or ignore

## 4) Per‑weave/loom awareness

- When you’re active in a project weave, recommendations emphasize goals and roadmap alignment
- When you’re collecting, it emphasizes organization, references, backlinks/tags

## 5) Memory, privacy, and clearing

- Memory is stored via the SQL Storage Adapter with TTL and auto‑summarization
- You can clear memory at any time; admins can enforce policies

## 6) Team announcements

- Admins can post team‑level announcements via the assistant channel
- These are visually distinct from private assistant messages

## 7) Troubleshooting

- If you see too many messages, lower frequency or enable strict quiet hours
- If nothing shows up, try Manual mode or ensure evaluations are enabled by your admin
